# JC1060 shared P4 beta contributor handoff

Date: 2026-10-11. Future physical testing owner: contributor Kayrosen
([kayrozen](https://github.com/kayrozen)). The operator has no JC1060 available.
Physical acceptance of the published beta is **NOT RUN**; preparing this handoff
did not contact the contributor or imply that testing had begun.

Update 2026-10-15: the [new signed integration kit](JC1060_CONTRIBUTOR_KIT_20261015.md)
is prepared locally on clean `c0ee8152` with the shared repairs and updated
DDJ-400 loop mappings. Its README, short checklist, recovery material, exact
BIN/ELF, signed inventory and source bundle are verified offline. It has not
been sent, published or installed. Use its separate identity/acceptance record;
the published beta below remains immutable.

Update 2026-10-14: Kayrosen supplied scoped JC1060/DDJ-400 testing on a separate
branch, finally source `4e3aa2b4`. The
[completed contributor review](reviews/2026-10-14-jc1060-contributor-review.md)
reconciles identities, listening and Observe counters, reproduces integration
defects and records failed warm-reset SD/USB MAIN recovery gates. Those results
do not transfer to the published beta or a new canonical candidate. Selective
integration is the next step; the branch is not merged by this review.

## Package and identity

The [shared P4 beta prerelease](https://github.com/dvucinozd/Pajoniiir/releases/tag/shared-p4-beta.1)
provides `jc1060-beta-kit.zip`, containing a signed `main-deck-jc1060.ddjota`,
raw application BIN, signed manifest, board/source/build configuration, partition
and bootloader artifacts, compiled profiles and SHA-256 inventory. Read
`BETA-IDENTITY.json` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` in the kit for the exact source and
image hashes; verify them before flashing. The matching ELF/map debug archive
is published separately for crash analysis.

The kit is an ordinary JC1060 configuration, not a recorder/alternate-UI/PSRAM
DMA experiment. Its firmware project must be `main-deck-jc1060` and its board
must be `jc1060`. An image or signed bundle for JC4880/M3 is not interchangeable.
Historical and final local software results are in the
[three-target matrix](validation/SHARED_P4_FINAL_BUILD_MATRIX_20261011.md);
new beta packaging provenance is in the
[beta record](validation/SHARED_P4_BETA_1_20261011.md).

## Hardware and installation

- Display: 1024 x 600, using the JC1060 BSP and its touch configuration.
- Controller: board USB0 / root0; Rekordbox storage: board USB1 / root1.
- MAIN and headphones: controller USB audio. Do not enable PCM5102A GPIO50/51/52
  or the ES8311 pacing path; the pins conflict with Ethernet.
- Network: board Ethernet provider. JC1060 has no Wi-Fi capability. Pro DJ Link
  is compiled but runtime default OFF; network interoperability is a separate gate.
- Refer to [board policies](SHARED_P4_BOARDS.md),
  [hardware wiring](HARDWARE_WIRING.md) and [OTA procedure](OTA-UPDATE.md).

For an already provisioned compatible layout and signed OTA runtime, upload
only `main-deck-jc1060.ddjota` through the local web update UI, with stopped
decks and stable power. Record startup and the exact accepted slot/identity.
For a first installation, confirm the actual flash size, bootloader and partition
layout before using wired ESP-IDF flashing. The package includes the build's
`flasher_args.json`; do not guess offsets or write a different board's table.
Application-only OTA cannot migrate the partition table. Preserve settings and
recovery artifacts as appropriate; do not perform a full-chip erase.

## Bounded first physical block

Use FLX4 first as the reference controller; qualify any other controller
separately. Record the controller VID/PID/profile, USB topology and source/ELF.

1. Cold boot: GUI geometry/colors, touch/backlight, storage/library count and
   Ethernet/web readiness. Confirm the exact board/project/source/version and
   image state through `/api/firmware` and `/api/status` when reachable.
2. With stopped decks, verify Browse and LOAD routing to both decks, LED state
   and screensaver first-action wake. A first PLAY consumed by wake is expected.
3. Run one short dual-deck block with a 44.1-kHz and a 48-kHz track, opposite
   pitch, both MT, loops and zoom 8. Exercise jog/Browse, PFL D1/D2 and headphone
   Mix/Volume; observe MAIN/cue and both waveforms. Include seek/loop exit and
   CUE-to-PLAY on each deck, then stop both.
4. Compare before/after counters: no new ISO packet/frame loss, PCM underrun,
   UAC drop/overflow, reset/WDT or stale deck/controller/library state. A missing
   counter is unavailable, not zero. Keep output-late separate and record its
   count, maximum and clusters alongside operator observations.

Avoid `/api/resources` heap walks and large diagnostic logs during playback;
these have interfered with USB audio timing on the M3 bench. Capture crash/bus
trace and large logs only after stopping. Do not reset away a first-fault capture.

Return a dated validation record with hashes, firmware/status snapshots,
before/after deltas, performed controls, physical audio/visual confirmation and
explicit NOT RUN items. Stop on a hard failure and retain evidence; a clean
short block is not long qualification. Subsequent reconnect/insertion-order,
long timing, Ethernet/Link and wider controller coverage remain separate.

## Operator dispositions and release boundary

JC4880's long soak was explicitly skipped by the operator on 2026-10-11;
that waiver is NOT RUN, not PASS and not a waiver for JC1060. S2 testing remains
operator-closed. No existing physical result transfers to a new beta image.
The beta is a GitHub prerelease, not a replacement for stable M2.5 or a public
OTA-channel update. Publishing it does not establish full shared-core acceptance.
